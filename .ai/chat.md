## Gemini Added Memories
- The user prefers to converse in Chinese.
- Always reply in Chinese, even if the user asks in English, unless they explicitly ask for a reply in English.
- When the user uses an English technical term in a Chinese sentence, in the Chinese reply, provide the Chinese translation followed by the original English term in parentheses. For example: 记忆 (memory), 索引 (index), 代码库 (repo).
- For third-party tools and frameworks (like nuget pkg, etc.), always prioritize web searches to find the latest, community-verified information and best practices before proposing a solution. Do not rely solely on existing knowledge.
- The user can use Alt + mouse drag for column selection to copy code from my output without line numbers.
- The user's Gemini CLI (@google/gemini-cli) and Auggie CLI (@augment/auggie) are managed by pnpm. Use pnpm for any future updates.
