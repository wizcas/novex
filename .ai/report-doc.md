## Reports and Docs Generation Rules

### AI Reports
- Unless explicitly specify `[no report]`, after each AI conversation, generate a summary report in folder `reports`, so that I can review them.
- You should respect the reports as your memories and contexts.
- All reports should be indexed with a numeral prefix to keep them in order, based on their creation time.
- If you ever found a report has no index number, add one as a fix. Such operations should **not** be written to any report.

### Docs
- For formal documentations, such as requirement analysis, technical specifications, architecture design, etc., they should be generated in folder `docs` instead of `reports`.
- Keep the docs easy to read while professional.
